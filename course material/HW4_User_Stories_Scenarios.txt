User Stories and Requirements


A. Consider your project and the agile user stories exercises done in class to complete the following:

1) Personas
2) User stories
3) Acceptance criteria

B. Create mock-ups for 3 full user scenarios (from end to end). Start with a user and depict each step until the scenario is completed.
Your user scenarios must be based on realistic user and content.
This means you should not create placeholders or content like user1, x, lorem ipsum. 
Our goal is to get into the context of the applicaiton as much as possible.

You may you a wireframe or drawing application to produce the scenarios.
